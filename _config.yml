description: Master student at Universidad de Concepci√≥n, my project consist on the theoretical study of chemical complexity in numerical simulations of circumstellar and protoplanetary disk formation, my work employs novel techniques to include chemistry over raw data from pre-made simulations, by using post-processing routines coupled with the chemistry package {\sc krome}, developed and maintained by Tommaso Grassi and Stefano Bovino, I'm able to study the effects of chemistry on base simulations without the need of on-the-fly chemistry and considerably reducing the cost on computational resources. I'm part of the Astrochemistry group lead by Dr. Stefano Bovino, specifically focused on theoretical astrochemistry and its influence on star forming regions and circumstellar systems. I'm also an user of the high-performance cluster {\sc kultrun} located in the astronomy department at Universidad de Concepci\'on.
